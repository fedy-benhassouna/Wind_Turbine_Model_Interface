# Wind Turbine Model Interface

This interface is a comprehensive tool designed for monitoring and analyzing wind turbine performance, providing real-time insights and historical data visualization. It is structured to offer users an at-a-glance understanding of key turbine metrics and environmental conditions.

### **Key Sections:**

1. **Turbine State:**
   - **Label:** "Current Turbine State."
   - **Status Indicator:** The turbine is currently marked as "ACTIVE," highlighted with a green background to indicate normal and operational status.
     
2. **Wind Speed:**
   - **Label:** "Current Wind Speed."
   - **Wind Speed Value:** Displays a current wind speed of 9.4 m/s.
   - **Status Description:** Below the wind speed value, there is a qualitative description "Moderate Breeze," providing a user-friendly interpretation of the wind condition.

3. **Graphs and Data Visualization:**   
   - **Graph 1 (Left):**
     - **Title:** "Active Power and Theoretical Power Curve The Last 12 Hours."
     - **Content:** This graph compares two data lines,  representing the actual power generated by the turbine and the theoretical power curve, based on  wind speed. It covers a 12-hour period, providing users with a short-term historical view of how the turbine has been performing relative to expected outputs.
   
   - **Graph 2 (Right):**
     - **Title:** "Wind Speed by Time Last 12 Hours."
     - **Content:** This graph shows the variation in wind speed over the last 12 hours, highlighting fluctuations and trends. It is particularly useful for correlating wind speed with the turbine's power generation performance.

### **Functionality:**

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The dashboard is designed to update in real-time, providing the current status of both the turbine and wind conditions, ensuring users have the most up-to-date information at their fingertips.
  
- **Data Analysis:** The integrated graphs offer a clear visual analysis of the turbine's performance, comparing actual output with theoretical expectations and tracking wind speed over time. This helps users identify patterns, potential issues, and optimize turbine operation.

- **User Interaction:** The presence of search and settings icons suggests that the platform is interactive, allowing users to customize their view, search for specific data, and adjust dashboard settings to suit their needs.
